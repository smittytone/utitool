// MARK: - Process Handling Functions

/**
 Generic macOS process creation and run function.

 Make sure we clear the preference flag for this minor version, so that
 the sheet is not displayed next time the app is run (unless the version changes)

 - Parameters:
    - app:  The location of the app.
    - with: Array of arguments to pass to the app.

 - Returns: A tuple containing an error code (or zero for no error) and either
            the STD OUT output on success, or STD ERR output on error.
